  description: A long, boxy rifle birthed by the mad scientists in the depths of Nanotrasen R&D. It sports a hyperburst fire mode, alongside a standard full auto and semi-auto fire mode. Some say the design is a clone of an old Earth rifle from centuries past, but NT's legal team seems to think otherwise.
