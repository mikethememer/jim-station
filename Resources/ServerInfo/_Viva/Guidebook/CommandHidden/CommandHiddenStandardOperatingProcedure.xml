  # Introduction

  Welcome to the hidden command SOP!

  Please note: Everything in here is metashielded, and has personal reveal conditions

  In order to lift the metashield, you have to somehow aquire a guidebook issued to every head of staff that contains this information, or sufficent proof that all of command is violating the public SOP
  (AHelp if you think you have enough to have your character realise so the admins know whats going on)

  If you find the guidebook for the Quartermaster, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Engineer, or Research Director, you unveil Clearance Level 1
  If you find the guidebook for the Captain, Head of Personel, or Head of Security, you unveil Clearance Level 2 and below
  If you (Somehow) find the guidebook for the Blue Shield Officer or the Nanotrasen Representative, you unveil Clearance Level 3 and below

  Higher clearance levels supercede any rules declared in lower ones

  Reminder:
  Knowing the hidden SOP is not a requirement for RP led riots and revolutions, but know is useful for helping incite them

  If your Unsure of what your character currently knows, send an AHelp, and any admin online will be happy to assist!
