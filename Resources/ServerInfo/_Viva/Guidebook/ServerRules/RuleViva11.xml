  # Rule 11.
  ## Check with other players about uncomfortable and triggering content
  
  If someone is clearly uncomfortable with the direction the situation is going, give them an option to opt out of it. On the flip side, don't abuse this to get away from hostile players and then snitch on them. If someone has to opt out of a situation due to uncomfortable content, such as torture or gore, everyone should treat it like it never included their character, and that includes them.
  
  ERP is not allowed on this server AT ALL and is disallowed by rule 5. Rule 11 (this rule) covers uncomfortable non-ERP subjects.
