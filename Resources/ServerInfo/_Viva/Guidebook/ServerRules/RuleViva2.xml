  # Rule 2.
  ## Do not use roleplay as an excuse to ruin other's fun.

  We have a lot more tolerance for what would be considered "self-antagonist" behavior on other servers, but that isn't because literally anything goes.

  Don't welderbomb security just because "it's what my character would do" while gesturing vaguely at 'insanity' or being 'wacky'. Have some actual roleplay [bold]motivations[/bold]
  to do what you do in general, and not just with violent stuff.

  Like in the case of welderbombing security, you're angry they confiscated your dog or something like that.

  Admins reserve judgement for what exactly this means in a given situation.
