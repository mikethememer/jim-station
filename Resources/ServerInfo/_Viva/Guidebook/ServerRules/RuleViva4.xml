  # Rule 4.
  ## Do not metagame.
  Hopefully, actively setting up meta shields and stuff can be avoided in terms of specific antagonists. But please don't do shit like try to make decisions of who to trust based on knowing what types of roles can spawn when you look in the code. "Role spawning" is not a real thing in the game world, just a mechanical abstraction.
