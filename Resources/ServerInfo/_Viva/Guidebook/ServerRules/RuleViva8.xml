  # Rule 8.
  ## Silicons must Follow Their Laws.
  
  Silicons should be following their laws to the best of their ability. If a law conflicts with another law the lower numbered (and higher placed) law wins. This means that if Law 2 is "Don't let harm come to crew" but Law 5 is "Harm all crew" Law 2 wins and Law 5 should be disregarded. Laws the modify the meaning of other laws do not have to be placed higher than the law(s) they are modifying.
